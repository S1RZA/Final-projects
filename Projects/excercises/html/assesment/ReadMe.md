### Explaining the code

## Introduction Page

# This page contains a little introduction of who am I, it also contains other linked projects that I've made, this allows the reader to know me better and also to watch what kind of projects and skills I have, I decided to do it kinda simple, just a header, little description of what I like, and then a footer. After I decided to use some gradiant for backgrounds, different background between the background of the page and the header, main card and footer

## CV page

# This page contains all my professional and educational information, this is for job purposes, nevertheless it shows some of my skills in CCS. I use some gradiant background, some shadows whitin and for the box, like the picture and the whole CV. also decided to use some hover for cetains parts of the text.
